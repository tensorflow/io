# TensorFlow I/O

[![GitHub CI](https://github.com/tensorflow/io/workflows/GitHub%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/tensorflow/io/actions?query=branch%3Amaster)

TensorFlow I/O is a collection of file systems and file formats that are not
available in TensorFlow's built-in support. A full list of supported file systems
and file formats by TensorFlow I/O can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/io/api_docs/python/tfio).

The use of tensorflow-io is straightforward with keras. Below is an example
to [Get Started with TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/quickstart/beginner) with
the data processing aspect replaced by tensorflow-io:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_io as tfio

# Read the MNIST data into the IODataset.
dataset_url = "http://storage.googleapis.com/cvdf-datasets/mnist/"
d_train = tfio.IODataset.from_mnist(
    dataset_url + "train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz",
    dataset_url + "train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz",
)

# Shuffle the elements of the dataset.
d_train = d_train.shuffle(buffer_size=1024)

# By default image data is uint8, so convert to float32 using map().
d_train = d_train.map(lambda x, y: (tf.image.convert_image_dtype(x, tf.float32), y))

# prepare batches the data just like any other tf.data.Dataset
d_train = d_train.batch(32)

# Build the model.
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential(
    [
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax),
    ]
)

# Compile the model.
model.compile(
    optimizer="adam", loss="sparse_categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"]
)

# Fit the model.
model.fit(d_train, epochs=5, steps_per_epoch=200)
```

In the above [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) example, the URL's
to access the dataset files are passed directly to the `tfio.IODataset.from_mnist` API call.
This is due to the inherent support that `tensorflow-io` provides for the `HTTP` file system,
thus eliminating the need for downloading and saving datasets on a local directory.

NOTE: Since `tensorflow-io` is able to detect and uncompress the MNIST dataset automatically if needed,
we can pass the URL's for the compressed files (gzip) to the API call as is.

Please check the official [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/io) for more
detailed and interesting usages of the package.

## Installation

### Python Package

The `tensorflow-io` Python package can be installed with pip directly using:
```sh
$ pip install tensorflow-io
```

People who are a little more adventurous can also try our nightly binaries:
```sh
$ pip install tensorflow-io-nightly
```

### Docker Images

In addition to the pip packages, the docker images can be used to quickly get started.

For stable builds:
```sh
$ docker pull tfsigio/tfio:latest
$ docker run -it --rm --name tfio-latest tfsigio/tfio:latest
```

For nightly builds:
```sh
$ docker pull tfsigio/tfio:nightly
$ docker run -it --rm --name tfio-nightly tfsigio/tfio:nightly
```

### R Package

Once the `tensorflow-io` Python package has been successfully installed, you
can install the development version of the R package from GitHub via the following:
```r
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tensorflow/io", subdir = "R-package")
```

## Performance Benchmarking

We use [github-pages](https://tensorflow.github.io/io/dev/bench/) to document the results of API performance benchmarks. The benchmark job is triggered on every commit to `master` branch and
facilitates tracking performance w.r.t commits.

## Contributing

Tensorflow I/O is a community led open source project. As such, the project
depends on public contributions, bug-fixes, and documentation. Please see:

- [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a guide on how to contribute.
- [development doc](docs/development.md) for instructions on the development environment setup.
- [tutorials](docs/tutorials) for a list of tutorial notebooks and instructions on how to write one.

### Build Status and CI

Because of manylinux2010 requirement, TensorFlow I/O is built with
Ubuntu:16.04 + Developer Toolset 7 (GCC 7.3) on Linux. Configuration
with Ubuntu 16.04 with Developer Toolset 7 is not exactly straightforward.
If the system have docker installed, then the following command
will automatically build manylinux2010 compatible whl package:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

ls dist/*
for f in dist/*.whl; do
  docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:/v -w /v --net=host quay.io/pypa/manylinux2010_x86_64 bash -x -e /v/tools/build/auditwheel repair --plat manylinux2010_x86_64 $f
done
sudo chown -R $(id -nu):$(id -ng) .
ls wheelhouse/*
```

It takes some time to build, but once complete, there will be python
`3.5`, `3.6`, `3.7` compatible whl packages available in `wheelhouse`
directory.

On macOS, the same command could be used. However, the script expects `python` in shell
and will only generate a whl package that matches the version of `python` in shell. If
you want to build a whl package for a specific python then you have to alias this version
of python to `python` in shell. See [.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)
Auditwheel step for instructions how to do that.

Note the above command is also the command we use when releasing packages for Linux and macOS.

TensorFlow I/O uses both GitHub Workflows and Google CI (Kokoro) for continuous integration.
GitHub Workflows is used for macOS build and test. Kokoro is used for Linux build and test.
Again, because of the manylinux2010 requirement, on Linux whl packages are always
built with Ubuntu 16.04 + Developer Toolset 7. Tests are done on a variatiy of systems
with different python3 versions to ensure a good coverage:

| Python | Ubuntu 18.04| Ubuntu 20.04 | macOS + osx9 | Windows-2019 |
| ------- | ----- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| 2.7 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A |
| 3.7 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 3.8 |  :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |


TensorFlow I/O has integrations with many systems and cloud vendors such as
Prometheus, Apache Kafka, Apache Ignite, Google Cloud PubSub, AWS Kinesis,
Microsoft Azure Storage, Alibaba Cloud OSS etc.

We tried our best to test against those systems in our continuous integration
whenever possible. Some tests such as Prometheus, Kafka, and Ignite
are done with live systems, meaning we install Prometheus/Kafka/Ignite on CI machine before
the test is run. Some tests such as Kinesis, PubSub, and Azure Storage are done
through official or non-official emulators. Offline tests are also performed whenever
possible, though systems covered through offine tests may not have the same
level of coverage as live systems or emulators.


|  | Live System | Emulator| CI Integration |  Offline |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Apache Kafka | :heavy_check_mark:  | | :heavy_check_mark:| |
| Apache Ignite |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| Prometheus |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| Google PubSub |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| Azure Storage |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| AWS Kinesis |   | :heavy_check_mark: |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| Alibaba Cloud OSS |   | | |  :heavy_check_mark: |
| Google BigTable/BigQuery |   | to be added | | |
| Elasticsearch (experimental) |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |
| MongoDB (experimental) |  :heavy_check_mark: | |:heavy_check_mark:| |
