# TensorFlow i/o JSON Datasets
[JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](https://www.json.org/) is an open-standard
file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting
of keyâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value). JSON 
format is widely used in machine learning and data science.

TensorFlow i/o JSON support mainly focuses the **record** array in JSON, here is
an example:
```json
[
  {
    "floatfeature": 1.1,
    "integerfeature": 2,
    "floatlabel": 1.2
  },
  {
    "floatfeature": 2.1,
    "integerfeature": 3,
    "floatlabel": 1.1  
  }
]
```

## Custom Ops
There are 2 different custom operators ([Eager Execution]
(https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager) support only) supported by JSON Datasets: 
`list_json_columns` and `read_json`.

### `list_json_columns`
`list_json_columns` is used to fetch all the column names of the JSON format files.
Here is an example:
```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

import os

import tensorflow as tf
# Enable Eager Execution.
tf.enable_eager_execution() 
import tensorflow_io.json as json_io

# Assume `example.json` is a JSON format file that contains the content of the
# example above.
filename = "example.json"
cols = json_io.list_json_columns(filename) 
```

### `read_json`
`read_json` can be used to read a specifed column of the JSON file into a Tensor.
Here is an example:
```python
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

import os

import tensorflow as tf
# Enable Eager Execution.
tf.enable_eager_execution() 
import tensorflow_io.json as json_io

# Assume `example.json` is a JSON format file that contains the content of the
# example above.
filename = "example.json"
cols = json_io.read_json(filename)
float_feature = json_io.read_json(
    feature_filename,
    feature_cols["floatfeature"])
```
