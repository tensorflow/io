    """IOTensor

    An `IOTensor` is a tensor with data backed by IO operations. For example,
    an `AudioIOTensor` is a tensor with data from an audio file, a
    `KafkaIOTensor` is a tensor with data from reading the messages of a Kafka
    stream server.

    The `IOTensor` is indexable, supporting `__getitem__()` and
    `__len__()` methods in Python. In other words, it is a subclass of
    `collections.abc.Sequence`.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> import tensorflow_io as tfio
    >>>
    >>> samples = tfio.IOTensor.from_audio("sample.wav")
    >>> print(samples[1000:1005])
    ... tf.Tensor(
    ... [[-3]
    ...  [-7]
    ...  [-6]
    ...  [-6]
    ...  [-5]], shape=(5, 1), dtype=int16)
    ```

    ### Indexable vs. Iterable

    While many IO formats are natually considered as iterable only, in most
    of the situations they could still be accessed by indexing through certain
    workaround. For example, a Kafka stream is not directly indexable yet the
    stream could be saved in memory or disk to allow indexing. Another example
    is the packet capture (PCAP) file in networking area. The packets inside
    a PCAP file is concatenated sequentially. Since each packets could have
    a variable length, the only way to access each packet is to read one
    packet at a time. If the PCAP file is huge (e.g., hundreds of GBs or even
    TBs), it may not be realistic (or necessarily) to save the index of every
    packet in memory. We could consider PCAP format as iterable only.

    As we could see the, availability of memory size could be a factor to decide
    if a format is indexable or not. However, this factor could also be blurred
    as well in distributed computing. One common case is the file format that
    might be splittable where a file could be split into multiple chunks
    (without read the whole file) with no data overlapping in between those
    chunks. For example, a text file could be reliably split into multiple
    chunks with line feed (LF) as the boundary. Processing of chunks could then
    be distributed across a group of compute node to speed up (by reading small
    chunks into memory). From that standpoint, we could still consider splittable
    formats as indexable.

    For that reason our focus is `IOTensor` with convinience indexing and slicing
    through `__getitem__()` method.

    ### Lazy Read

    One useful feature of `IOTensor` is the lazy read. Data inside a file is not
    read into memory until needed. This could be convenient where only a small
    segment of the data is needed. For example, a WAV file could be as big as
    GBs but in many cases only several seconds of samples are used for training
    or inference purposes.

    While CPU memory is cheap nowadays, GPU memory is still considered as an
    expensive resource. It is also imperative to fit data in GPU memory for
    speed up purposes. From that perspective lazy read could be very helpful.

    ### Association of Meta Data

    While a file format could consist of mostly numeric data, in may situations
    the meta data is important as well. For example, in audio file format the
    sample rate is a number that is necessary for almost everything. Association
    of the sample rate with the sample of int16 Tensor is more helpful,
    especially in eager mode.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> import tensorflow_io as tfio
    >>>
    >>> samples = tfio.IOTensor.from_audio("sample.wav")
    >>> print(samples.rate)
    ... 44100
    ```

    ### Nested Element Structure

    The concept of `IOTensor` is not limited to a Tensor of single data type.
    It supports nested element structure which could consists of many
    components and complex structures. The exposed API such as `shape()` or
    `dtype()` will display the shape and data type of an individual Tensor,
    or a nested structure of shape and data types for components of a
    composite Tensor.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> import tensorflow_io as tfio
    >>>
    >>> samples = tfio.IOTensor.from_audio("sample.wav")
    >>> print(samples.shape)
    ... (22050, 2)
    >>> print(samples.dtype)
    ... <dtype: 'int32'>
    >>>
    >>> features = tfio.IOTensor.from_json("feature.json")
    >>> print(features.shape)
    ... (TensorShape([Dimension(2)]), TensorShape([Dimension(2)]))
    >>> print(features.dtype)
    ... (tf.float64, tf.int64)
    ```

    ### Access Columns of Tabular Data Formats

    May file formats such as Parquet or Json are considered as Tabular because
    they consists of columns in a table. With `IOTensor` it is possible to
    access individual columns through `__call__()`.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> import tensorflow_io as tfio
    >>>
    >>> features = tfio.IOTensor.from_json("feature.json")
    >>> print(features.shape("floatfeature"))
    ... (2,)
    >>> print(features.dtype("floatfeature"))
    ... <dtype: 'float64'>
    >>>
    >>> print(features("floatfeature").shape)
    ... (2,)
    >>> print(features("floatfeature").dtype)
    ... <dtype: 'float64'>
    ```

    ### Conversion from and to Tensor and Dataset

    When needed, `IOTensor` could be converted into a `Tensor` (through
    `to_tensor()`, or a `tf.data.Dataset` (through `to_dataset()`, to
    suppor operations that is only available through `Tensor` or
    `tf.data.Dataset`.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> import tensorflow as tf
    >>> import tensorflow_io as tfio
    >>>
    >>> features = tfio.IOTensor.from_json("feature.json")
    >>>
    >>> features_tensor = features.to_tensor()
    >>> print(features_tensor())
    ... (<tf.Tensor: id=21, shape=(2,), dtype=float64, numpy=array([1.1, 2.1])>,
    ...  <tf.Tensor: id=22, shape=(2,), dtype=int64, numpy=array([2, 3])>)
    >>>
    >>> features_dataset = features.to_dataset()
    >>> print(features_dataset)
    ... <_IOTensorDataset shapes: ((), ()), types: (tf.float64, tf.int64)>
    >>>
    >>> dataset = tf.data.Dataset.zip((features_dataset, labels_dataset))
    ```
