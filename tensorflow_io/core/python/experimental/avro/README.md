This folder only contains the tests.
Needs to be changed for open source.

I did not move these into the regular structure test structure because of:
1) To run these tests inside the wrapper MP with LinkedIn's internal TF setup
2) To easily attach the debugger from Intellij to these tests
3) To enable quick changes to the test code inside the wrapper MP and then 
   transferring them back here
