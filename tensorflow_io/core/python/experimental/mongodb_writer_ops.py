class MongoDBWriter:
    """Write documents to mongoDB.

    The writer can be used to store documents in mongoDB while dealing with tensorflow
    based models and inference outputs. Without loss of generality, consider an ML
    model that is being used for inference. The outputs of inference can be modelled into
    a structured record by enriching the schema with additional information( for ex: metadata
    about input data and the semantics of the inference etc.) and can be stored in mongo
    collections for persistence or future analysis.

    To make a connection and write the documents to the mongo collections,
    the `tfio.experimental.mongodb.MongoDBWriter` API can be used.

    Example:

    >>> URI = "mongodb://mongoadmin:default_password@localhost:27017"
    >>> DATABASE = "tfiodb"
    >>> COLLECTION = "test"
    >>> writer = tfio.experimental.mongodb.MongoDBWriter(
        uri=URI, database=DATABASE, collection=COLLECTION
    )
    >>> for i in range(1000):
    ...    data = {"key{}".format(i): "value{}".format(i)}
    ...    writer.write(data)

    """

    def __init__(self, uri, database, collection):
        """Initialize the dataset with the following parameters

        Args:
            uri: A string, representing the uri of the mongo server or replicaset.
                To connect to a MongoDB server with username and password
                based authentication, the following uri pattern can be used.
                Ex: `"mongodb://mongoadmin:default_password@localhost:27017"`.

                Connecting to a replica set is much like connecting to a
                standalone MongoDB server. Simply specify the replica set name
                using the `?replicaSet=myreplset` URI option.
                Ex: "mongodb://host01:27017,host02:27017,host03:27017/?replicaSet=myreplset"

                Connection to a secure cluster via CA certs can be achieved by setting
                the respective TLS options to the URI.
                Ex: "mongodb://host01:27017/?tls=true&sslCertificateAuthorityFile=/opt/ca.pem"

            database: A string, representing the database in the standalone MongoDB
                server or a replica set to connect to.
            collection: A string, representing the collection from which the documents
                have to be retrieved.
